## Instructions for Playign the Memory Game

The game is played by clicking on an initial card and then clicking on a second card that will hopefully match the first card that was clicked.  If the cards are a successful match, then the matched cards will remain flipped over.  If two clicked cards do not match, then the cards will be flipped back over.  The object of the game is to match all of the cards until there are 8 total matches or all cards are exposed and sucessfully matched. You and reset the game, at anytime if you want to start over, by clicking the restart button at the top right corner of the game screen above the cards. As you play the game you will have a 3 star rating at the game's start and the game will be timed. The more moves that are required to find matching cards, the less stars you will ultimately end up with.  You want to make the least about of moves in order to keep a high star rating.  When you win the game, a pop up screen will appear and display how long it took you to win the game, how many moves it took to win the game, and your star rating at the end of the game.
